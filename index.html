      <p class="job-title"><span class="lead"><strong>Sr. Web Application Developer.</strong> &mdash; I'm a creative technologist with nearly a decade of experience</span> who enjoys collaborating to solve problems. As a programmer I value quality and craft. As a leader I value transparency. As a creative I value interesting problems and beautiful ideas. My strong background in server-side software and complex problem spaces like leasing and airline reservations means I'm ready to tackle challenging domains. I'm equally comfortable building rich client side applications in javascript and implementing semantic, pixel-perfect designs in HTML and CSS. Please contact me for further details and references.</p>

We had to integrate with a dozen backend systems, and we had to get it done in six months.</p>

          <p><span class="lead">As the technical lead for an agile team</span> we built an app to help people care for their aging loved ones.  We wrapped a native iOS app around a rich, cross-platform web application with a Rails backend. We kept quality high by TDDing all the client JS code and the serverside Ruby.  Then, everything was continuously integrated by our Rake build and a selenium test suite.</p>

It forces you to take a much longer view of what you are building.  You have to factor in customer support, targeting multiple platforms and having a strategy for the lifecycle of previous versions.</p>
